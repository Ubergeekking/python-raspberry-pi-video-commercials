Python Video Player with commercial breaks for Raspberry Pi

This script is for use with the Raspberry Pi utilizing OMXPlayer and DBus to play tv shows with commercial interruptions at set points in time.

I use this to play old 80's tv shows along with 80's tv commercials for that authentic 80's vibe.
